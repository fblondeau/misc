<h1>
  FreeBSD 11.x on Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite
</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong style="color: red">Update 2017/03/07:</strong>
    New image available for 11.0-RELEASE-p8
  </li>
  <li><strong style="color: red">Update 2014/09/21:</strong>
    New version of the <a href="#build">build script</a> creates more inodes in
    root filesystem.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite is a neat little device that costs less than
  US$100, has three Ethernet ports, and can run FreeBSD/mips. It's based on the
  <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/mips/Octeon">Cavium Octeon</a>
  CN5020 platform and features a dual core 500mhz MIPS64 processor, 512MB RAM,
  and 4GB storage on removable USB.

<p>
  This page provides ready-to-use images of recent FreeBSD releases. Thanks to the
  open nature of the EdgeRouter Lite, it's very easy to install and use these
  images; just follow the instructions below. Thanks to the fine folks at the
  FreeBSD Project, building your own is almost as easy. A script to build them,
  along with instructions, is also provided. Special thanks is due to Juli
  Mallett and Warner Losh, without whose hard work and generous assistance none
  of this would be possible.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Note that this is experimental software which comes with no warranty of
  any kind.</b> These builds are works in progress and are not fit or suitable
  for any purpose whatsoever. By proceeding you assume all risks.
</p>

<p>
  On my EdgeRouter Lite, the builds provided below are stable and pretty much
  fully functional. There are two outstanding issues:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Performance could be a little better, though it's more than adequate for
  my home Internet connection. Basic packet passing between two Gigabit hosts
  seems to top out at about 250Mbits/sec.

  <li>There is currently no way to pass boot options (such as single-user mode)
  to the kernel from U-Boot.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Hardware crypto acceleration via <code>/dev/crypto</code> seems to work. Use
  AES in CBC mode to see a huge speedup over CTR.

  Getting Started
  </h2>

<p>
  All you need are the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>a computer with a USB port</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/EdgeRouter-ERLite-3-512MB-Ethernet-Router/dp/B00CPRVF5K">
  the device</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GL3MOY/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">
  an RJ-45 serial console cable</a></li>

  <li>unless your computer already has a 9-pin serial port,
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OWNYA/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1">
  a USB-to-DB9 adapter</a>

  <p>
    and last but certainly not least,
  </p>

  <li>a Phillips-head screwdriver.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The EdgeRouter's Lite on-board storage is a removable USB drive. Installing
  the image is just a matter of opening the device, taking the drive out,
  writing the image to it, and putting it back in.
</p>

    removable USB storage is on the right.
  </font>
</p>

<p>
  Configuring the bootloader afterwards only takes a minute, and then you're
  done. If you haven't already set up a serial console for your device, though,
  you'll need to do that first.
</p>

<h2>
  Serial Console
</h2>

<p>
  You may wish to <a href="#install2">skip to the next section</a> if you
  already have a working connection to the serial console of your EdgeRouter
  Lite.
</p>

<p>
  The serial console allows you to interact with the device's firmware before
  boot, which you will need to do to configure it to boot FreeBSD. Since you'll
  need it anyway, the provided images don't enable the ssh server by default,
  and you'll log into your new FreeBSD system for the first time this way, as
  well.
</p>

<p>
  First, connect the RJ-45 console cable to the port marked "Console" on the
  device.  Connect the other end to a 9-pin serial port on your computer if you
  have one; otherwise connect it to a USB-to-DB9 adapter, and connect that to a
  USB port on your computer.
</p>

<p>
  Next, you will need any serial communication software. On FreeBSD and Linux
  systems, you can install <code>minicom</code> by entering one of the
  following commands:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td><b>System</b></td>                <td><b>Command</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>FreeBSD 10.0+</td>                <td><code>pkg install minicom</code></td>
  <tr><td>FreeBSD 9.x</td>                  <td><code>pkg_add -r minicom</code></td>
  <tr><td>Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.</td>   <td><code>apt-get install minicom</code></td>
  <tr><td>Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, etc.</td>   <td><code>yum install minicom</code></td>
</table>

<p>
  On other Unix-like systems, you can try building
  <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/minicom">minicom from source</a>. On
  MacOS you can do that or try to install it from Fink. On Windows you're on
  your own; try <a href="http://realterm.sourceforge.net/">RealTerm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Determine the name of the serial port you're using. On FreeBSD systems, USB
  serial adapters will have names like <code>/dev/ttyU0</code> and hard-wired
  serial ports, <code>/dev/ttyu0</code> with a lowercase 'u.' On Linux systems,
  the equivalent files are <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> and
  <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>, respectively. If you have more than one, the number
  might be greater than '0.' On Windows, it's usually called <code>COM1</code>,
  otherwise <code>COM2</code>, <code>COM3</code>, and so on. On MacOS, it might
  be <code>/dev/cu.usbserial</code>; look for other <code>/dev/cu.*</code>
  files if not.
</p>

<p>
  Configure the software to use the port, with settings 115200 8N1 and no flow
  control. Those are usually close to the defaults, but it's important to get
  them right as accidentally leaving flow control enabled or another error
  could leave you with a partially or not at all working connection. To
  configure minicom, enter the command <code>minicom -s</code> as root, then
  navigate to the "Serial Port Setup" menu.
</p>

<p>
  Start the software and plug power into the device. You should see the EdgeOS
  Linux kernel boot and ultimately present you with a login prompt. If your
  device was already powered on, just hit the Enter key once or twice to get
  a new login prompt. Type something at the login prompt to verify that your
  connection is working properly. For example, you can log into EdgeOS (the
  default user and password are both <code>ubnt</code>) and run the
  <code>halt</code> command to shut it down and prepare for installing FreeBSD.
</code>

<h2>
  <a name="install2"/>
  Installation
</h2>

<p>
  Unplug the device completely and open the plastic case by removing all the
  screws. Notice the lone USB port containing a removable drive on one end of
  the board. You can use your fingers to take the drive out, but it's a little
  slippery, so you might need to use your shirt for grip. It turns out there's
  a benefit to wearing shirts around the house, after all.
</p>

<p>
  Plug the drive into your computer. For FreeBSD, Linux and other Unix-like
  systems, the command to write the image to the drive is below. You'll need to
  download <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">the <code>xz</code> software</a>
  for MacOS or if it's otherwise not installed. On Windows, which doesn't have
  <code>dd</code>, you're on your own; try the
  <a href="https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer">Ubuntu Image Writer</a>
  (you'll also have to download <code>xz</code>).
</p>

<p>
  Determine the device name assigned by your system. On FreeBSD, it will be
  something like <code>/dev/da3</code>, where the '3' will be the first
  available number after all your other SCSI and USB drives. On Linux, 
  it will be something like <code>/dev/sdf</code>, where the 'f' will be the
  first available letter after all your other ATA, SCSI and USB drives. On
  MacOS, it will be something like <code>/dev/rdisk1</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  Ensure it wasn't mounted automatically, by substituting your device name in
  the following commands and running them as root:
</p>

<pre>
mount | grep '^/dev/<i>devicename</i>' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n1 umount
mount | grep '^/dev/<i>devicename</i>'
</pre>

<p>
  If these commands produce no output, and you're certain you have the device
  name correct, proceed with the following command as root, substituting your
  device name and the filename of the image you downloaded or built.

  <b>Warning: a simple typo in the device name can wipe out your system's boot
  partition.  Check carefully before hitting the enter key.</b>
</p>

<pre>
  xzcat freebsd-ubiquiti-edgerouter-lite.debug.image.xz | dd of=/dev/<i>devicename</i> bs=1024k
</pre>

</p>
  This will take a few minutes. When finished, remove the drive and put it back
  into the EdgeRouter Lite. Reconnect the console cable, ensure your terminal
  software is running, and plug power into the device.
</p>

<h2>
  Configuring U-Boot
</h2>

<p>
  The first time you power up the device with the new image, the bootloader
  won't know what to do and will drop you to a prompt. Enter these commands to
  save the command sequence needed to boot FreeBSD to a variable
  (<code>boot_freebsd</code> in this example):
</p>

<pre>
  setenv boot_freebsd 'fatload usb 0 $loadaddr kernel/kernel ; bootoctlinux $loadaddr coremask=0x3'
  saveenv
</pre>

<p>
  You can now boot to FreeBSD simply by entering this command:
</p>

<pre>
  run boot_freebsd
</pre>

<p>
  Optionally, enter the following command to skip the pre-boot countdown.
  Personally, using minicom, I am still able to access the U-Boot console by
  sending a <code>BREAK</code> at the first signs of life on the serial port, so
  I prefer not to have a delay. If you don't want to <b>risk locking yourself
  out</b> of the U-Boot console, skip this command or replace the <code>0</code>
  with something like <code>3</code> (it's in seconds):
</p>

<pre>
  setenv bootdelay 0
</pre>

<p>
  Finally, to boot directly to FreeBSD by default, enter these commands:
</p>

<pre>
  setenv bootcmd_orig $(bootcmd)
  setenv bootcmd 'run boot_freebsd'
  saveenv
  reset
</pre>

<h2>
  <a name="growing"/>
  Growing the Filesystem
</h2>

<p>
  At this point, you should be looking at a fully booted multi-user FreeBSD
  system. One of the first things you'll want to do is expand the filesystem to
  use all the free space left over on the drive after you wrote the relatively
  small image to it.
</p>

<p>
  Log in as root, then enter this command to bring the system to single-user
  mode:
</p>

<pre>
  init 1
</pre>

Press <code>ENTER</code> to accept the default shell, then enter the following
commands:

<pre>
  df -h /
  mount -o ro /
  gpart resize -i 2 da0
  gpart resize -i 1 da0s2
  growfs /dev/da0s2a
  df -h /
</pre>

You should be able to see much more available space in the second
<code>df</code> invocation. Enter the <code>reboot</code> command to reboot
back into multi-user mode.

<h2>
  Success!
</h2>

Change the root password, edit the <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> file to set up
networking and services, and refer to
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/">The FreeBSD Handbook</a>
for system administration basics.

  <a name="build"/>
  Building Your Own
</h2>

<ul>
 </li>
   <em style="color: red">Update 2014/09/21:</em> the latest version here fixes
   the problem of too few inodes, first spotted by Maximilian Pr&auml;ger. Also
   available
   <a href="https://github.com/ndorf/FreeBSD_ERL/commits/master/mkerlimage">via <code>git</code></a>
   with change history.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To build your own version from the FreeBSD sources, you will also need a
  computer running the same version of FreeBSD you wish to build. If your
  FreeBSD version is too old, a newer source tree's <code>buildworld</code> may
  fail. I recommend first building, installing and booting the same version of
  the source on the build system as you plan to cross-build for the router.
  Refer to <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/">The FreeBSD
  Handbook</a> for more information about obtaining FreeBSD sources, the
  <code>buildworld</code> process and updating your FreeBSD system.
</p>

<p>
  Even if you use another OS, you can install FreeBSD inside a virtual machine,
  and use it to build a version of itself for your EdgeRouter Lite. 
</p>

<p>
  <a href="mkerlimage">The <code>mkerlimage</code> script</a> does everything
  needed to build the image from a fresh copy of the FreeBSD sources. It
  performs the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If <code>sys/mips/conf/ERL</code> doesn't exist, creates a simple one
  based on the <code>OCTEON1</code> configuration.</li>

  <li>Sets <code>TARGET=mips</code> and <code>TARGET_ARCH=mips64</code>, then
  invokes <code>buildworld</code> and <code>buildkernel</code> to build the
  base system and kernel.</li>

  <li>Invokes <code>installworld</code> and <code>distribution</code> to
  install the newly built system to a temporary root.</li>

  <li>Packages the whole thing up in a ~760MByte image, consisting of an MS-DOS
  partition for the kernel (so that U-Boot can read it), and a UFS fileystem
  for the rest. (Note that you can always <a href="#growing">grow the
  filesystem</a> to the size of the media after installing and booting the
  image.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Please review the script before running it. In particular, make sure that
  you check the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The FreeBSD build system stores intermediate object files in
  <code>/usr/obj</code> by default. For the mips64 build, this will require
  at least 1.3GBytes of free space. Set the <code>MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX</code>
  environment variable if you want to put them somewhere else.</li>

  <li>The script itself requires at least 2.0GBytes of temporary space to hold
  the installation root, UFS image, and final result image before compression.
  Check the <code>temp_root</code> setting at the top of the script, or it will
  all go to <code>/tmp</code> by default.

  <li>Check that the number of jobs in the <code>make_args</code> setting at
  the top of the script is appropriate for your build machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  On success, you will have an <code>xz</code>-compressed image, ready to
  decompress and <code>dd</code> onto the destination. Follow the
  <a href="#install">installation instructions, above</a>.
